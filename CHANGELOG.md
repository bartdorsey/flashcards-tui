### Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- **src/core/types.py**: Immutable data classes (FlashCard, FlashcardSet, StudySession, etc.)
- **src/io/operations.py**: Pure I/O functions for YAML/JSON handling
- **src/core/session.py**: Study session management with immutable state
- **src/core/statistics.py**: Statistics calculations and performance tracking
- **src/ui/interface.py**: Rich-based terminal UI (956 lines, largest module)
- **main.py**: Application orchestration and argument parsing

#### Key Dependencies
- **Rich 14.0.0**: Terminal UI framework with panels and live updates
- **PyYAML 6.0.2**: YAML file parsing for flashcard sets
- **Pytest 8.4.1**: Testing framework with comprehensive coverage
- **Catppuccin theme**: Consistent color scheme throughout
- **Pygments**: Syntax highlighting for code examples

#### Search Implementation
- **Two-tier filtering system**:
  - `_filter_options()`: Basic menu label search
  - `_filter_flashcard_options()`: Deep content search through questions, answers, and code
- **Terminal-adaptive UI**: Dynamic viewport sizing based on terminal height
- **Keyboard handling**: Raw terminal input for arrow keys, search, backspace, escape

### Configuration
- **Version tracking**: Semantic versioning with `src/__version__.py`
- **Flexible statistics storage**: `flashcard_stats.json` with custom file support
- **Schema validation**: Complete YAML schema for flashcard format validation
- **Black formatting**: 79-character line length configured in `pyproject.toml`

### User Experience
- **Intuitive navigation**: Arrow keys throughout with visual feedback
- **Immediate feedback**: Real-time search filtering and progress indicators
- **Accessible design**: Clear instructions and help text
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks and informative error messages
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Unix/Linux systems with termios fallback for Windows

### Performance
- **Viewport optimization**: Only renders visible menu items for large lists
- **Efficient search**: Fast substring matching across all flashcard content
- **Memory management**: Immutable data structures prevent accidental mutations
- **Terminal adaptation**: Responsive UI that adapts to different terminal sizes
